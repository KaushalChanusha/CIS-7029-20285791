Hyphen is a revolutionary ‘cobot’ (collaborative robot), an automated assistant designed to work in tandem with Chipotle team members. Hyphen is being tuned to craft perfectly portioned burrito bowls and salads along an automated makeline, while a crew member makes burritos, tacos, and quesadillas above the line.
 
Chipotle’s investment in Hyphen originates from Cultivate Next, a $50 million fund targeting early-stage innovations that align with Chipotle’s mission to Cultivate a Better World.
 
Around 65% of Chipotle’s digital orders consist of bowls or salads, so with Hyphen on board, team members would be freed up to focus on guest experiences, while increasing the amount of digital orders during peak periods.
